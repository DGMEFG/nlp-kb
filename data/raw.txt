Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. The first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, Harry Potter follows a young wizard who discovers Harry Potter's magical heritage on Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, when Harry Potter receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter makes close friends and a few enemies during Harry Potter's first year at the school and with the help of Harry Potter's friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry Potter faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry Potter's parents, but failed to kill Harry Potter when Harry Potter was just 15 months old.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999, and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of the book's sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making the novel the fourth best-selling book of all time.
Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullying.
The Harry Potter series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.
Harry Potter lives with Harry Potter's neglectful uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, delivers an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, revealing that Harry Potter's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards. When Harry Potter was just a year old, a powerful but malevolent dark wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered Harry Potter's parents; Harry Potter survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry Potter's forehead. Unknown to Harry Potter, this act made Harry Potter famous in the wizarding world.
Hagrid escorts Harry Potter to Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in London. Harry Potter's parents have left Harry Potter a fortune kept in Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which Harry Potter uses to buy school supplies and a wand from Ollivander's. The cores of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, making the wands "brothers". Hagrid gifts Harry Potter an owl, whom Harry Potter names as Hedwig, as a birthday present. A month later, Harry Potter boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9+3⁄4. En route to Hogwarts, Harry Potter befriends fellow first year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two students initially dislike.
Harry Potter runs afoul of Draco Malfoy, the spoiled son of a prominent wizard. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards, while Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger are sorted into Gryffindor.
Harry Potter's broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. Harry Potter comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy tricks Harry Potter and Ron Weasley into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after curfew. Hermione Granger, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley later save Hermione Granger from a troll during a Halloween celebration and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger believe Snape is attempting to enter the trapdoor.
During Harry Potter's first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to buck him off. Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione Granger he jinxed Harry Potter's broom. Harry Potter receives an anonymous Christmas gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires. Harry Potter sees his parents.
A newspaper report later describes an attempted robbery at the same vault in Gringotts from which Rubeus Hagrid retrieved an item for Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. The object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Firenze, a forest centaur, warns Harry Potter that Voldemort is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.
As you've described, various obstacles force Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to remain behind while Harry Potter proceeds. Harry Potter encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Quirrell jinxed Harry's broom and let the troll into the school; Severus Snape was actually protecting Harry. Voldemort, whose face has regrown on the back of Quirrell's head, is revealed to be the professor's secret master. Harry Potter is forced to stand before the Mirror of Erised. The mirror recognises Harry's lack of greed for the philosopher's stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. Harry's scar begins hurting, and he passes out.
Harry Potter awakens in the school's infirmary. He survived Voldemort because his mother Lily sacrificing her life for him left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned Quirrell to die. Albus Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas Flamel alive, has been destroyed with Flamel's consent to prevent it being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry Potter returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school year.
Harry Potter, a young orphan, is the protagonist Rowling imagined as "a scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard." Rowling developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry Potter came to be in this situation and how Harry's life unfolded from there.Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry Potter's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry Potter's forehead, which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry Potter has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.
Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's age, is Rowling's description of the ultimate best friend "always there when you need him".Ron Weasley is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. Ron Weasley grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although Ron Weasley's family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. Ron Weasley's loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.
Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione Granger as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath Hermione Granger's swottiness". Despite Hermione Granger's nagging efforts to keep Harry Potter and Ron Weasley out of trouble, Hermione Granger becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save Hermione Granger from a troll and Hermione Granger's magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. Hermione Granger has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.
Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that Neville Longbottom's grandmother gives Neville Longbottom a Remembrall, to remind Neville Longbottom if Neville Longbottom forgets something. Neville Longbottom's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save Neville Longbottom's life when Neville Longbottom was eight. Despite Neville Longbottom's timidity, Neville Longbottom will fight anyone after some encouragement or if Neville Longbottom thinks it is right and important.
Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and Rubeus Hagrid's wand was snapped in half (resulting in Rubeus Hagrid never to use a wand again), though Professor Dumbledore let Rubeus Hagrid stay on as the school's gamekeeper, a job which enables Rubeus Hagrid to give lavish affection, care and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Rubeus Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and, later, Hermione Granger, but Rubeus Hagrid's carelessness makes Rubeus Hagrid unreliable.
Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into Professor Albus Dumbledore's belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Professor Albus Dumbledore, while renowned for Professor Albus Dumbledore's achievements in magic, shrugs off praise, though Professor Albus Dumbledore is aware of Professor Albus Dumbledore's own brilliance. Rowling described Professor Albus Dumbledore as the "epitome of goodness".
Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun, teaches Transfiguration and is able to transform Professor Minerva McGonagall into a cat. Professor Minerva McGonagall is Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.
Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry Potter's mother Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that Petunia Dursley uses for spying on the neighbours. As a Muggle, Petunia Dursley regards Petunia Dursley's magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that Lily never existed.
Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.
Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoilt bully and Harry Potter's cousin.
Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. Draco Malfoy is arrogant about Draco Malfoy's skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard and wizards who do not share Draco Malfoy's views. Draco Malfoy's parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco Malfoy avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry Potter and Harry Potter's friends into trouble.
Oliver Wood is Harry Potter's Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering, and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. Reputedly Professor Quirrell was a brilliant scholar, but Professor Quirrell's nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Professor Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that Professor Quirrell is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Professor Quirrell's head.
Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Professor Severus Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, Professor Severus Snape's own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry Potter. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry Potter's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry Potter and Harry Potter's friends to think Professor Severus Snape is aiding Voldemort.
Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins, has a cat named Mrs. Norris who aids Argus Filch's constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.
Other members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed Professor Binns' own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever Peeves can.
In the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry Potter's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero, Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes Harry Potter's miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined Harry as a "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard" and says Rowling transferred part of Rowling's pain about losing Rowling's mother to Harry.
During the book, Harry Potter makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, "always there when you need him". Rowling has described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".
Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described Albus Dumbledore as "the epitome of goodness". Albus Dumbledore's right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.
The main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate, and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when Voldemort tries to kill baby Harry Potter. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and Voldemort's backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:
The basic idea... Harry, Rowling saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And Rowling knew Harry didn't know Harry was a wizard. And so then Rowling kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, and then Voldemort tried to kill Harry—Voldemort tried to curse him. But for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, Voldemort, who has been in hiding ever since.
The book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990, Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, "One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product." Then, Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. 
Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to a literary agent and a publisher and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was "so much better than anything else".
Bloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 advance and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched. Cunningham was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to Cunningham and Cunningham believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the pen name J. K. Rowling just before publication.
In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries. Rowling's original name, "Joanne Rowling", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to "Joanne" completely.) The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers. Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction. Taylor created the cover for the first edition.
Lindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments, wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997. Fraser described Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as "a hugely entertaining thriller" and Rowling as "a first-rate writer for children". Another early review, in The Herald, said: "I have yet to find a child who can put it down." Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in The Guardian and The Sunday Times and in September 1997 Books for Keeps, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five. Sunday Times said: "comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified", while The Guardian called it "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit" and The Scotsman said it had "all the makings of a classic".
In 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. The Smarties award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years. The following year, Philosopher's Stone won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children. It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults, but did not win. Beckett commented that books that were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example, the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year. By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001. A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.
Platform 9+3⁄4, from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.
Scholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book. Arthur Levine thought that "philosopher" sounded too archaic for readers and after some discussion (including the proposed title "Harry Potter and the School of Magic"), the American edition was published in September 1998 under the title J.K. Rowling suggested, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. J.K. Rowling later said that J.K. Rowling regretted this change and would have fought it if J.K. Rowling had been in a stronger position at the time. Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from "crumpet" to "muffin". While J.K. Rowling accepted the change from both the British English "mum" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant "mam" to the American variant "mom" in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, J.K. Rowling vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of Philosopher's Stone. However, Philip Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits. Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.
On BookBrowse, a site that aggregates book reviews such as media reviews, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone received a favorable review from "Critics' Opinion". At first, the most prestigious reviewers ignored Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which noted complexity, depth, and consistency in the world that J.K. Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise. A year later, the US edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1998, and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone also won Parenting Magazine's Book of the Year Award for 1998, the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults. In 2012, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was ranked number 3 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by School Library Journal.
In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone topped the New York Times list of best-selling fiction and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings. Publishers Weekly's report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).
In May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that was released on 1 October 2008 to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release. For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.
By mid-2008, official translations of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had been published in 67 languages. By November 2017, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Lowland Scots. Bloomsbury published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek, with the latter being described as "one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries".
Philip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom J.K. Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both Jane Austen and J.K. Rowling greatly encourage re-reading because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the storyline. For example, Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry Potter often has to re-examine Harry Potter's ideas near the ends of books. Some social behavior in the Harry Potter books is reminiscent of Austen, for example, the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirize social behavior and give characters names that express their personalities. However, in Philip Nel's opinion, J.K. Rowling's humor is more based on caricature, and the names J.K. Rowling invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories. Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these names express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. J.K. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C. S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Philip Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, J.K. Rowling combines literary genres—fantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman, and many others.
Some reviewers compared Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as Roald Dahl's successor, but none had attained anything near Roald Dahl's popularity with children. In a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Roald Dahl, including the one in the top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone resembled parts of Roald Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost James's parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts, one fat and one thin, rather like Vernon and Petunia Dursley, who treated Harry Potter as a servant. However, Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.
Nancy Knapp and Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley. Tad Brennan commented that J.K. Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer: "rapid, plain, and direct in expression." Stephen King admired "the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable" and concluded that these details worked because J.K. Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.
Nicholas Tucker described the early Harry Potter books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories. Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school where the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which the teachers were associated. Characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with Vernon and Petunia Dursley. Evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs. Norris. Harry Potter, a mistreated orphan who found Harry Potter's true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society, including many social stereotypes. However, Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.
Susan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the Harry Potter books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability, or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer Voldemort's own horrific version of order. As a side effect, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione Granger notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.
Philip Nel suggested that the unflattering characterization of the extremely conventional, status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was J.K. Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the "preferred norm," while J.K. Rowling was a single mother. Harry Potter's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in Harry Potter's happiness whenever Harry Potter is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in Harry Potter's treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father figures.

In 1999, J.K. Rowling sold the film rights of the first two Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported £1 million. Rowling demanded that the principal cast be kept strictly British, but allowed for the casting of Irish actors such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore and of foreign actors as characters of the same nationalities in later books. After extensive casting, filming of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone began in September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London, with production ending in July 2001. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released in London on 14 November 2001. Reviewers' comments were positive, as reflected by an 81% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and by a score of 65% at Metacritic, representing "generally favourable reviews".
Writers on education and business subjects have used the book as an object lesson. Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students, while Madam Hooch illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills. Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class.
Stephen Brown noted that the early Harry Potter books, especially Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to treat the stories as "a marketing masterclass", full of enticing products and brand names. For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was introduced under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.
