"Harry Potter" is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry Potter's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).
The "Harry Potter" series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and by Scholastic Press in the United States. The series spans multiple genres, such as fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story, which incorporates elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance. The world of "Harry Potter" explores various themes and incorporates numerous cultural meanings and references. Major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, and death.
Since the release of the first novel, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," on 26 June 1997, the books have gained immense popularity, received positive reviews, and achieved commercial success worldwide. They have appealed to a broad adult audience as well as younger readers, and are widely regarded as pillars of modern literature. As of February 2023, the books have sold more than 600 million copies globally, establishing them as the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into 85 languages. The last four books have each set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final installment selling approximately 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.
The series follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. In the first book, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," Harry resides in a cupboard under the stairs in the home of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle, and cousin, who mistreat him. At the age of 11, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He encounters a half-giant named Hagrid, who presents him with a letter of acceptance to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents, Lily and James Potter, possessed magical abilities and were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort when Harry was an infant. When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse backfired, apparently destroying Voldemort, while Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. This event propelled Harry to fame within the wizarding community.
Harry enrolls as a student at Hogwarts and is assigned to Gryffindor House. He forms a friendship with Ron Weasley, a member of a large but financially disadvantaged wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch born to non-magical (Muggle) parents. The trio develop a rivalry with Draco Malfoy, a wealthy pure-blood student. Harry encounters the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore; the potions professor, Severus Snape, who harbors animosity towards him; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell. Quirrell is revealed to be allied with Voldemort, who exists as a feeble spirit. The first book concludes with Harry confronting Voldemort, who seeks to acquire the Philosopher's Stone, a substance granting eternal life, in his quest to regain a physical form.
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" narrates Harry's second year at Hogwarts. Students become victims of attacks and are petrified by an unidentified creature, with wizards of Muggle descent being the primary targets. The assaults seem linked to the legendary Chamber of Secrets and bear resemblance to incidents from fifty years ago. Harry discovers his ability to speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes, which he learns is uncommon and associated with the Dark Arts. When Hermione falls victim to an attack and Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley, is abducted, Harry and Ron unravel the chamber's mysteries and venture inside. Harry realizes that Ginny was possessed by an ancient diary containing the memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort's younger self. Acting on Voldemort's behalf, Ginny opened the chamber and released the basilisk, an ancient serpent capable of killing or petrifying individuals through direct or indirect eye contact. With assistance from Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes, and the Sword of Gryffindor, Harry defeats the basilisk and destroys the diary.
In the third installment, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry discovers that he is the target of Sirius Black, an escaped convict who is believed to have played a role in his parents' murder. Dementors, beings that feed on despair, are on the hunt for Sirius, and they guard the school. Harry grapples with his response to the dementors and seeks guidance from Remus Lupin, a new professor who teaches him the Patronus charm. On a stormy night, Ron is seized by a large black dog and dragged into the Shrieking Shack, a notorious haunted building. Harry and Hermione pursue him and discover that the dog is Sirius Black. Lupin arrives and reveals that Sirius was a close friend of Harry's father, James Potter, and was wrongly accused of betrayal by another of James's friends, Peter Pettigrew, who has been masquerading as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises, Lupin transforms into a werewolf and flees, prompting the group to chase after him. Surrounded by dementors, they are rescued by a figure resembling James, who conjures a stag-shaped Patronus. Later, it is revealed that this figure is a future version of Harry, who, along with Hermione, has traveled back in time using a device called a Time Turner. Together, they help Sirius escape on a Hippogriff, while Pettigrew manages to evade capture.
In Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts, recounted in "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," the school hosts the Triwizard Tournament, a competition involving Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. Harry is involuntarily selected as the second Hogwarts champion, alongside Cedric Diggory, causing his friends to distance themselves from him. Despite the strain on their relationship, Harry and Cedric jointly win the Triwizard Cup. However, they are transported to a graveyard where Peter Pettigrew murders Cedric and resurrects Voldemort using Harry's blood. Voldemort summons his followers, the Death Eaters, but Harry escapes after a duel. Upon returning to Hogwarts, it is revealed that Barty Crouch, Jr., disguised as the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, orchestrated Harry's participation in the tournament, secretly aided him, and facilitated his transportation to Voldemort.
In the fifth installment, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the Ministry of Magic denies the return of Voldemort. Dumbledore re-establishes the Order of the Phoenix, a covert organization aimed at opposing Voldemort. Simultaneously, the Ministry tightens its grip on Hogwarts by appointing Dolores Umbridge as High Inquisitor, granting her increasing authority. Umbridge's ban on practical Defence Against the Dark Arts instruction prompts Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form "Dumbledore's Army," a clandestine group to continue their education. Harry experiences recurring dreams of a sinister corridor in the Ministry, culminating in a vision of Sirius being tortured. He rushes to the Ministry with his friends, only to fall into Voldemort's trap, planted in his mind. The group is ambushed by Death Eaters but rescued by the Order of the Phoenix, although Sirius perishes in the ensuing battle. A confrontation between Dumbledore and Voldemort persuades the Ministry to acknowledge Voldemort's return. A prophecy regarding Harry and Voldemort is unveiled: one must ultimately vanquish the other.
In the sixth installment, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," Snape assumes the role of Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, while Horace Slughorn takes over as Potions master. Harry stumbles upon an old textbook annotated by the Half-Blood Prince, which enhances his performance in Potions class. He also undergoes private sessions with Dumbledore, delving into memories concerning Voldemort's early life stored in a Pensieve. From a tipsy Slughorn, Harry learns that the latter once taught Tom Riddle and that Voldemort fragmented his soul to create Horcruxes. Accompanied by Dumbledore, Harry embarks on a journey to a distant lake to eliminate a Horcrux; although they succeed, Dumbledore's strength wanes. Upon their return, they encounter Draco Malfoy and Death Eaters launching an assault on the school. The book concludes with Professor Snape, the eponymous Half-Blood Prince, fatally striking down Dumbledore.
In "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the concluding installment of the series, Lord Voldemort seizes control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron, and Hermione uncover the existence of the Deathly Hallows, legendary artifacts said to confer mastery over death. The trio infiltrates the ministry, pilfering a locket Horcrux, and journeys to Godric's Hollow, where they are assailed by Nagini, Voldemort's serpent. Guided by a silver doe Patronus, they locate the Sword of Gryffindor, which they use to vanquish the locket. They acquire another Horcrux from Gringotts and head to Hogwarts, where they engage in a final showdown with the Death Eaters. Voldemort, consumed by paranoia, murders Snape, who imparts his memories to Harry before perishing. Through these memories, Harry discovers Snape's unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore and his own unwitting status as a Horcrux. Surrendering himself to Voldemort, Harry succumbs to death. Nonetheless, the defenders of Hogwarts persist in their resistance. Ultimately, Harry is resurrected and confronts Voldemort, ultimately emerging victorious by vanquishing him.


In the realm of Harry Potter, there are many individuals who can be classified as either friends or foes. These characters play significant roles in the narrative, influencing the storyline in various ways. Some characters, such as Harry's close companions Ron and Hermione, are steadfast allies who provide unwavering support throughout his journey. Conversely, there are adversaries like Voldemort, who pose significant threats to Harry and his allies, seeking to undermine their efforts at every turn. Amidst the intricate web of relationships in the wizarding world, allegiances can shift, and characters may find themselves aligning with unexpected allies or facing betrayal from former friends. This dynamic interplay between friends and enemies adds depth to the storytelling, keeping readers engaged as they navigate the ever-changing landscape of alliances and conflicts in Harry Potter's universe.
In the magical universe of Harry Potter, a rich tapestry of relationships weaves its way through the narrative, showcasing a diverse array of characters who either stand by Harry's side as friends or oppose him as enemies.

Among his closest allies are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, steadfast companions whose loyalty and bravery prove invaluable time and again. Ron's humor and loyalty, coupled with Hermione's intelligence and resourcefulness, form a formidable trio alongside Harry, each complementing the other's strengths and weaknesses.

On the opposing side looms the dark presence of Voldemort, the ultimate antagonist whose quest for power and domination drives much of the conflict in the series. His followers, the Death Eaters, carry out his bidding with ruthless efficiency, spreading fear and chaos wherever they go.

Throughout the series, characters may find themselves straddling the line between friend and foe, their allegiances shifting as circumstances evolve. Severus Snape, for instance, is a complex figure whose loyalties remain ambiguous until the very end, his actions motivated by a mixture of love, guilt, and duty.

Other characters, such as Draco Malfoy, undergo their own journeys of redemption and growth, transitioning from adversaries to reluctant allies as they grapple with their conscience and the consequences of their actions.

Amidst the ever-shifting landscape of alliances and conflicts, themes of friendship, loyalty, and betrayal resonate deeply, adding layers of complexity to the story and keeping readers captivated as they navigate the intricacies of the wizarding world.

Harry Potter lives with his neglectful uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, delivers an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, revealing that Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards. When Harry was just a year old, a powerful but malevolent dark wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered his parents; Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. Unknown to Harry, this act made him famous in the wizarding world.

Hagrid escorts Harry to Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in London. Harry's parents have left him a fortune kept in Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which he uses to buy school supplies and a wand from Ollivander's. The cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, making them "brothers". Hagrid gifts Harry an owl, whom he names as Hedwig, as a birthday present. A month later, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9+3⁄4. En route to Hogwarts, Harry befriends fellow first year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two boys initially dislike.

Harry runs afoul of Draco Malfoy, the spoiled son of a prominent wizard. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted into Gryffindor.

Harry's broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. Harry comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after curfew. Hermione, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry and Ron later save Hermione from a troll during a Halloween celebration and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry, Ron, and Hermione believe he is attempting to enter the trapdoor.

During Harry's first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to buck him off. Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione he jinxed Harry's broom. Harry receives an anonymous Christmas gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires. Harry sees his parents.

A newspaper report later describes an attempted robbery at the same vault in Gringotts from which Hagrid retrieved an item for Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. The object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Firenze, a forest centaur, warns Harry that Voldemort is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione, and Ron fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.

Various obstacles force Ron and Hermione to remain behind while Harry proceeds. Harry encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He jinxed Harry's broom and let the troll into the school; Snape was protecting Harry. Voldemort, whose face has regrown on the back of Quirrell's head, is revealed to be the professor's secret master. Harry is forced to stand before the Mirror of Erised. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. Harry's scar begins hurting, and he passes out.

Harry awakens in the school's infirmary. He survived Voldemort because his mother sacrificing her life for him left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned him to die. Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas Flamel alive, has been destroyed with Flamel's consent to prevent its being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school year.

Harry Potter is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a "scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard."[3] She developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there.[4] Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead,[4] which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.
Ron Weasley is Harry's age, and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend "always there when you need him".[5] He is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.
Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".[6] Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.
Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins. His cat, Mrs. Norris, aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.
Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is aiding Voldemort.
Other members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.

In the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero, Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard"[3] and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.[8] During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, "always there when you need him".[5] Rowling has described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".[6]

Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described him as "the epitome of goodness".[7] His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.

The main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate,[9] and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:
The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... And—so—but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.
While Harry is living with the Dursleys, Aunt Marge comes to visit. When he and his late parents are insulted by Marge, an angry Harry accidentally inflates her. Harry packs up his stuff and leaves the house, choosing to spend the last weeks of summer at the Leaky Cauldron inn in London. While there, Harry is warned that a former follower of Voldemort, named Sirius Black, is seeking him out after having escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban.

At Hogwarts, the guards of Azkaban, known as the Dementors, patrol the school looking for Black. Harry is unusually affected by their presence, and asks help from Remus Lupin, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, in learning to repel them. Lupin teaches Harry the incredibly difficult Patronus charm, but Harry isn't able to produce a full-bodied Patronus to fight off the Dementors. Meanwhile, Black is reported to have been sighted in the village of Hogsmeade, close to Hogwarts.

Harry is given a secret map by Fred and George Weasley, which reveals everyone inside the castle and its grounds. Harry uses it to sneak into Hogsmeade without permission. Hiding inside a pub, he overhears a conversation in which he learns that Black is actually his godfather, and that he killed his own best friend, Peter Pettigrew, while also betraying Harry's father, James, to Voldemort.

Harry, Ron and Hermione visit Hagrid at his hut, and are surprised to find Ron's missing pet rat, Scabbers, hiding there. As they walk back to the castle with Scabbers, Ron is attacked by a large dog. The dog drags Ron into a secret tunnel and disappears, coming out on the other side, inside the Shrieking Shack in Hogsmeade. The dog is revealed to be Black in his Animagus form.

Harry and Hermione reach the Shack, followed by Lupin, who spots them on Harry's map. Lupin disarms Harry, then explains why he believes Black to be innocent. Black claims that the crimes attributed to him were actually committed by Pettigrew, who escaped suspicion by faking his own death. Pettigrew is also an Animagus, and has been hiding as Ron's rat Scabbers this whole time. Harry suggests handing Pettigrew over to the Dementors.

While walking back to the castle, the full moon suddenly emerges and Lupin, secretly a werewolf, starts transforming. Black turns into the dog to protect the others, and Pettigrew escapes amid the chaos. Harry, Hermione and Black are accosted by Dementors, and Black ends up being captured.

While Black is held captive inside a tower in Hogwarts, Dumbledore confirms with Harry and Hermione that he is indeed innocent. He instructs them to save Black, by going back in time and setting him free, before he is handed over to the Dementors. Using a Time Turner, which Hermione has had since the beginning of the year to get to all her classes, they travel back a few hours. Present-day Harry saves his past self, and the past versions of Hermione and Black from Dementors using a Patronus. He then allows Black to be captured by Snape, before using Hagrid's hippogriff, Buckbeak, to release him from the tower and escape.

The next day, Lupin is forced to resign as his secret identity as a werewolf is now known to the school. Harry is upset at not spending more time with his godfather, Black, but Dumbledore asks him to take comfort in having saved his life. On the train journey back to London, Harry receives a letter from Black, who also sends a replacement pet owl for Ron.
After Harry heads to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom the next morning and explains the details he learned from Dobby, Hermione devises a plan where Harry and Ron create a distraction in Potions so she can steal the remaining ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape's private stores. Shortly afterward, when McGonagall circulates a sign-up list for students remaining at school during Christmas, Harry, Ron, and Hermione also sign up. This provides them the perfect opportunity to use their Polyjuice Potion. Harry creates a disturbance during Potions class by throwing a Filibuster firework into Goyle's cauldron, causing enough chaos for Hermione to succeed without trouble. However, Snape suspects Harry's involvement after finding the firework.
Later, Harry joins a Duelling Club taught by his least favorite teachers, Lockhart and Snape. During a practice battle at the first meeting, Draco Malfoy conjures a snake to attack Harry. Lockhart tries to banish it but inadvertently sets it loose on the students. Harry instinctively commands the snake to stop, surprising himself when it obeys. However, Justin Finch-Fletchley and others misinterpret Harry speaking Parseltongue as him encouraging the snake, associating him with Salazar Slytherin, who was also known for this rare gift.
When a Herbology lesson is cancelled, Harry talks with Hagrid, who reveals the school's roosters are mysteriously being killed. Moments after leaving Hagrid, Harry finds a petrified Justin Finch-Fletchley and Nearly-Headless Nick. Peeves alerts the school, and a Hufflepuff student, Ernie Macmillan, accuses Harry of being caught red-handed.
Weeks later, Ron and Harry overhear Argus Filch complaining about his workload and leaving. They arrive at Moaning Myrtle's bathroom to find it flooded. Myrtle, a sulking ghost, explains that she flooded it because somebody flushed a diary down the toilet and onto her. Harry picks it up and discovers it once belonged to someone named T.M. Riddle, but the diary is completely blank. Ron recalls from his detention that Riddle had won an award for special service to the school fifty years earlier, which coincided with another slug attack on the trophy. Hermione deduces that Riddle might have received his award for catching the culprit responsible for the attacks during that time.
Despite all attempts to extract information from the diary failing, Harry feels a strange urge to keep it. On Valentine's Day, Ron and Harry are dismayed to find Lockhart has spread dwarves dressed as cupids throughout the school to deliver Valentines, thinking it would boost morale due to his belief that he made the attacks stop. One cupid-dwarf manages to deliver a singing valentine to Harry. While trying to avoid embarrassment, Harry trips and spills ink all over his bag. Ginny notices the diary and reacts with horror. Draco Malfoy also tries to snatch the diary, but Harry stuns him in anger, ignoring Percy Weasley's attempts to intervene, which leads to Percy scolding Harry.
Later, Harry realizes that despite the ink spill, the diary remains unstained. He tries writing in it and, to his surprise, Riddle writes back. Riddle explains that he was the one who caught the person responsible for opening the Chamber of Secrets the last time and offers to show Harry what happened. Harry agrees and gets drawn into a memory from Riddle.
Transported back to June 13, 1943, Harry witnesses the school's then-headmaster, Armando Dippet, telling Riddle that the school might close because a Muggle-born girl has died. Riddle is concerned because this could mean returning to the Muggle orphanage he detests. Dippet speculates that Riddle himself is Muggle-born, but Riddle corrects him, revealing he is actually a half-blood, with a witch mother who died and a Muggle father after whom he was named Tom, and middle name Marvolo after his wizard grandfather.
After being dismissed by Dippet and a younger Dumbledore, Riddle leads Harry to the dungeons where he accuses Hagrid of harboring the creature responsible for the recent attacks - a young Acromantula. Despite Hagrid's protests that the spider, named Aragog, has never harmed anyone, Riddle reports him to Dippet.
Having witnessed this memory, Harry now believes that Hagrid was responsible for opening the Chamber fifty years ago and is the current culprit.
Days later, Professor McGonagall informs the students that the Mandrake Draught will soon be ready. Later that same day, Harry and Ron manage to manipulate Lockhart - who is leading them to their next class - into allowing them to go by stroking his ego. Just as they congratulate themselves, Professor McGonagall catches them, and Harry has to improvise an excuse - they were going to visit Hermione in the Hospital Wing, which now has restricted access. They reluctantly agree to maintain their alibi, but this time, instead of merely lingering around Hermione's petrified form, Harry notices a tightly clutched piece of paper in her hand. This note reveals what Hermione had discovered before being attacked: she had deduced, based on compelling evidence, that the monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk, an enormous "King of Serpents". This explains the mysterious voice only Harry could hear, due to his ability to speak Parseltongue.
The Basilisk kills by direct eye contact, but no one died because none had directly gazed into its lethal eyes: Colin Creevey saw it through his camera, Justin Finch-Fletchley through Nearly-Headless Nick (who couldn't die "again" and was only petrified), Mrs. Norris saw its reflection in the flooded bathroom waters, and Hermione and Penelope Clearwater saw it through mirrors used to look around corners. Harry also learns from the note that spiders flee from it and a rooster's crowing can fatally harm the Basilisk (explaining the roosters' deaths at Hogwarts that year). Scribbled on the note is the word "pipes", indicating the serpent travels through plumbing, leading them to deduce the Chamber of Secrets entrance is in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
With the mystery solved, Harry and Ron decide to inform the teachers and head to the staff room. There, they overhear the teachers discussing another attack. They eavesdrop and discover Ginny has been abducted by the Basilisk, and the heir of Slytherin has left another chilling message: "HER SKELETON WILL LIE IN THE CHAMBER FOREVER". They also learn Hogwarts will close the next day. The teachers assign Lockhart, who had boasted about handling the situation, to confront the monster. Disheartened, Lockhart leaves for his room.
Harry and Ron decide to share what they know with Lockhart. They find him in his room, panicked and preparing to flee. When questioned about why a supposedly skilled wizard like him would run, Lockhart confesses he's a fraud who used Memory Charms on those who actually accomplished feats he claimed as his own in his books. He attempts to use a Memory Charm on Harry and Ron, but they disarm him and, wielding their wands, escort him to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
Harry then realizes that Lord Voldemort was merely an alias, and his true birth name was Tom Marvolo Riddle. Riddle explains that he couldn't bear to use the name of a Muggle father who abandoned him upon learning his wife was a witch descended from Salazar Slytherin. Instead, he rearranged the letters to forge a new name he knew would strike fear as he rose to become the "greatest sorcerer in the world."
Harry counters, insisting that the true greatest sorcerer is Albus Dumbledore, a sentiment widely acknowledged. Even at the height of Voldemort's power, he feared Dumbledore and now exists in a diminished state. Riddle retorts that Dumbledore has been expelled from Hogwarts by the mere memory of him. Harry passionately declares that Dumbledore's presence remains potent, and to demonstrate his loyalty, he summons Fawkes the phoenix to him, along with the Sorting Hat—both of which Riddle dismisses as utterly useless.
