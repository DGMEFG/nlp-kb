Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. The first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, Harry Potter follows a young wizard who discovers Harry Potter's magical heritage on Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, when Harry Potter receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter makes close friends and a few enemies during Harry Potter's first year at the school and with the help of Harry Potter's friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry Potter faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry Potter's parents, but failed to kill Harry Potter when Harry Potter was just 15 months old.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999, and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of the book's sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making the novel the fourth best-selling book of all time.
Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullying.
The Harry Potter series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.
Harry Potter lives with Harry Potter's neglectful uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, delivers an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, revealing that Harry Potter's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards. When Harry Potter was just a year old, a powerful but malevolent dark wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered Harry Potter's parents; Harry Potter survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry Potter's forehead. Unknown to Harry Potter, this act made Harry Potter famous in the wizarding world.
Hagrid escorts Harry Potter to Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in London. Harry Potter's parents have left Harry Potter a fortune kept in Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which Harry Potter uses to buy school supplies and a wand from Ollivander's. The cores of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, making the wands "brothers". Hagrid gifts Harry Potter an owl, whom Harry Potter names as Hedwig, as a birthday present. A month later, Harry Potter boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9+3⁄4. En route to Hogwarts, Harry Potter befriends fellow first year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two students initially dislike.
Harry Potter runs afoul of Draco Malfoy, the spoiled son of a prominent wizard. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards, while Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger are sorted into Gryffindor.
Harry Potter's broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. Harry Potter comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy tricks Harry Potter and Ron Weasley into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after curfew. Hermione Granger, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley later save Hermione Granger from a troll during a Halloween celebration and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger believe Snape is attempting to enter the trapdoor.
During Harry Potter's first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to buck him off. Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione Granger he jinxed Harry Potter's broom. Harry Potter receives an anonymous Christmas gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires. Harry Potter sees his parents.
A newspaper report later describes an attempted robbery at the same vault in Gringotts from which Rubeus Hagrid retrieved an item for Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. The object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Firenze, a forest centaur, warns Harry Potter that Voldemort is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.
As you've described, various obstacles force Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to remain behind while Harry Potter proceeds. Harry Potter encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Quirrell jinxed Harry's broom and let the troll into the school; Severus Snape was actually protecting Harry. Voldemort, whose face has regrown on the back of Quirrell's head, is revealed to be the professor's secret master. Harry Potter is forced to stand before the Mirror of Erised. The mirror recognises Harry's lack of greed for the philosopher's stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. Harry's scar begins hurting, and he passes out.
Harry Potter awakens in the school's infirmary. He survived Voldemort because his mother Lily sacrificing her life for him left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned Quirrell to die. Albus Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas Flamel alive, has been destroyed with Flamel's consent to prevent it being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry Potter returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school year.
Harry Potter, a young orphan, is the protagonist Rowling imagined as "a scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard." Rowling developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry Potter came to be in this situation and how Harry's life unfolded from there.Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry Potter's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry Potter's forehead, which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry Potter has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.
Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's age, is Rowling's description of the ultimate best friend "always there when you need him".Ron Weasley is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. Ron Weasley grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although Ron Weasley's family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. Ron Weasley's loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.
Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione Granger as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath Hermione Granger's swottiness". Despite Hermione Granger's nagging efforts to keep Harry Potter and Ron Weasley out of trouble, Hermione Granger becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save Hermione Granger from a troll and Hermione Granger's magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. Hermione Granger has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.
Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that Neville Longbottom's grandmother gives Neville Longbottom a Remembrall, to remind Neville Longbottom if Neville Longbottom forgets something. Neville Longbottom's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save Neville Longbottom's life when Neville Longbottom was eight. Despite Neville Longbottom's timidity, Neville Longbottom will fight anyone after some encouragement or if Neville Longbottom thinks it is right and important.
Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and Rubeus Hagrid's wand was snapped in half (resulting in Rubeus Hagrid never to use a wand again), though Professor Dumbledore let Rubeus Hagrid stay on as the school's gamekeeper, a job which enables Rubeus Hagrid to give lavish affection, care and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Rubeus Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and, later, Hermione Granger, but Rubeus Hagrid's carelessness makes Rubeus Hagrid unreliable.
Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into Professor Albus Dumbledore's belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Professor Albus Dumbledore, while renowned for Professor Albus Dumbledore's achievements in magic, shrugs off praise, though Professor Albus Dumbledore is aware of Professor Albus Dumbledore's own brilliance. Rowling described Professor Albus Dumbledore as the "epitome of goodness".
Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun, teaches Transfiguration and is able to transform Professor Minerva McGonagall into a cat. Professor Minerva McGonagall is Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.
Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry Potter's mother Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that Petunia Dursley uses for spying on the neighbours. As a Muggle, Petunia Dursley regards Petunia Dursley's magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that Lily never existed.
Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.
Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoilt bully and Harry Potter's cousin.
Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. Draco Malfoy is arrogant about Draco Malfoy's skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard and wizards who do not share Draco Malfoy's views. Draco Malfoy's parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco Malfoy avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry Potter and Harry Potter's friends into trouble.
Oliver Wood is Harry Potter's Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering, and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. Reputedly Professor Quirrell was a brilliant scholar, but Professor Quirrell's nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Professor Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that Professor Quirrell is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Professor Quirrell's head.
Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Professor Severus Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, Professor Severus Snape's own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry Potter. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry Potter's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry Potter and Harry Potter's friends to think Professor Severus Snape is aiding Voldemort.
Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins, has a cat named Mrs. Norris who aids Argus Filch's constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.
Other members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed Professor Binns' own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever Peeves can.
In the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry Potter's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero, Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes Harry Potter's miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined Harry as a "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard" and says Rowling transferred part of Rowling's pain about losing Rowling's mother to Harry.
During the book, Harry Potter makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, "always there when you need him". Rowling has described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".
Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described Albus Dumbledore as "the epitome of goodness". Albus Dumbledore's right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.
The main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate, and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when Voldemort tries to kill baby Harry Potter. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and Voldemort's backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:
The basic idea... Harry, Rowling saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And Rowling knew Harry didn't know Harry was a wizard. And so then Rowling kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, and then Voldemort tried to kill Harry—Voldemort tried to curse him. But for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, Voldemort, who has been in hiding ever since.
The book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990, Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, "One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product." Then, Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. 
Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to a literary agent and a publisher and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was "so much better than anything else".
Bloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 advance and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched. Cunningham was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to Cunningham and Cunningham believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the pen name J. K. Rowling just before publication.
In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries. Rowling's original name, "Joanne Rowling", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to "Joanne" completely.) The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers. Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction. Taylor created the cover for the first edition.
Lindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments, wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997. Fraser described Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as "a hugely entertaining thriller" and Rowling as "a first-rate writer for children". Another early review, in The Herald, said: "I have yet to find a child who can put it down." Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in The Guardian and The Sunday Times and in September 1997 Books for Keeps, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five. Sunday Times said: "comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified", while The Guardian called it "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit" and The Scotsman said it had "all the makings of a classic".
In 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. The Smarties award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years. The following year, Philosopher's Stone won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children. It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults, but did not win. Beckett commented that books that were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example, the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year. By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001. A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.
Platform 9+3⁄4, from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.
Scholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book. Arthur Levine thought that "philosopher" sounded too archaic for readers and after some discussion (including the proposed title "Harry Potter and the School of Magic"), the American edition was published in September 1998 under the title J.K. Rowling suggested, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. J.K. Rowling later said that J.K. Rowling regretted this change and would have fought it if J.K. Rowling had been in a stronger position at the time. Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from "crumpet" to "muffin". While J.K. Rowling accepted the change from both the British English "mum" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant "mam" to the American variant "mom" in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, J.K. Rowling vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of Philosopher's Stone. However, Philip Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits. Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.
On BookBrowse, a site that aggregates book reviews such as media reviews, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone received a favorable review from "Critics' Opinion". At first, the most prestigious reviewers ignored Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which noted complexity, depth, and consistency in the world that J.K. Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise. A year later, the US edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1998, and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone also won Parenting Magazine's Book of the Year Award for 1998, the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults. In 2012, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was ranked number 3 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by School Library Journal.
In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone topped the New York Times list of best-selling fiction and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings. Publishers Weekly's report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).
In May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that was released on 1 October 2008 to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release. For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.
By mid-2008, official translations of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had been published in 67 languages. By November 2017, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Lowland Scots. Bloomsbury published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek, with the latter being described as "one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries".
Philip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom J.K. Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both Jane Austen and J.K. Rowling greatly encourage re-reading because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the storyline. For example, Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry Potter often has to re-examine Harry Potter's ideas near the ends of books. Some social behavior in the Harry Potter books is reminiscent of Austen, for example, the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirize social behavior and give characters names that express their personalities. However, in Philip Nel's opinion, J.K. Rowling's humor is more based on caricature, and the names J.K. Rowling invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories. Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these names express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. J.K. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C. S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Philip Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, J.K. Rowling combines literary genres—fantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman, and many others.
Some reviewers compared Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as Roald Dahl's successor, but none had attained anything near Roald Dahl's popularity with children. In a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Roald Dahl, including the one in the top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone resembled parts of Roald Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost James's parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts, one fat and one thin, rather like Vernon and Petunia Dursley, who treated Harry Potter as a servant. However, Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.
Nancy Knapp and Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley. Tad Brennan commented that J.K. Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer: "rapid, plain, and direct in expression." Stephen King admired "the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable" and concluded that these details worked because J.K. Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.
Nicholas Tucker described the early Harry Potter books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories. Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school where the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which the teachers were associated. Characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with Vernon and Petunia Dursley. Evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs. Norris. Harry Potter, a mistreated orphan who found Harry Potter's true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society, including many social stereotypes. However, Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.
Susan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the Harry Potter books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability, or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer Voldemort's own horrific version of order. As a side effect, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione Granger notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.
Philip Nel suggested that the unflattering characterization of the extremely conventional, status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was J.K. Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the "preferred norm," while J.K. Rowling was a single mother. Harry Potter's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in Harry Potter's happiness whenever Harry Potter is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in Harry Potter's treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father figures.
The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and later in the US on 2 June 1999. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 simultaneously by Bloomsbury and Scholastic. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release. The seventh and final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published on 21 July 2007. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.

In 1999, J.K. Rowling sold the film rights of the first two Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported £1 million. Rowling demanded that the principal cast be kept strictly British, but allowed for the casting of Irish actors such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore and of foreign actors as characters of the same nationalities in later books. After extensive casting, filming of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone began in September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London, with production ending in July 2001. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released in London on 14 November 2001. Reviewers' comments were positive, as reflected by an 81% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and by a score of 65% at Metacritic, representing "generally favourable reviews".
Writers on education and business subjects have used the book as an object lesson. Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students, while Madam Hooch illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills. Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class.
Stephen Brown noted that the early Harry Potter books, especially Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to treat the stories as "a marketing masterclass", full of enticing products and brand names. For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was introduced under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.
The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices.
Several commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-human, non-magical, and non-living people. Some commentators regard the story's diary that writes back as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent.
The film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became (at the time) the fifth highest-grossing film ever and received generally favourable reviews. Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.
While spending the summer at the Dursleys, twelve-year-old Harry Potter is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. He says Harry is in danger and must not return to Hogwarts. Harry refuses, so Dobby magically ruins Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's dinner party. Unaware of Dobby's visit, a furious Uncle Vernon locks Harry in his room. The Ministry of Magic sends a notice accusing Harry of performing underage magic and threatening dismissal from Hogwarts.
The three Weasley brothers, Ron, Fred and George, arrive in their father's flying Ford Anglia and rescue Harry, taking him to their home. Harry and the Weasley family travel to Diagon Alley for school supplies. They run into Hermione Granger and meet Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco, and also Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer and adventurer who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. At King's Cross station, Harry and Ron cannot enter Platform 9¾ and miss the Hogwarts Express. They fly in Mr Weasley's car to Hogwarts, crashing into the Whomping Willow on school grounds and damaging Ron's wand. The car then escapes into the forest.
Later, Harry is the only one who hears a strange voice emanating from the castle walls. Soon after, Mr Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, is found petrified, along with a bloody warning scrawled on a wall: "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware". Salazar Slytherin, one of the school's founders, created the Chamber after a dispute with fellow founders on admitting Muggle-born students. Some in the wizarding community disdain Muggle-born wizards like Hermione, believing pure-bloods are superior. The Chamber supposedly houses a monster that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.
During a Quidditch game, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm. Lockhart blunders an attempt to repair it, sending Harry to the hospital overnight. Dobby visits Harry and reveals he jinxed the Bludger and sealed the portal at King's Cross. He says the Chamber of Secrets was once opened years before. Dobby also tells Harry that house-elfs like himself serve one master their entire life, and cannot be freed unless given proper clothing. After another attack, students attend a defensive duelling class, during which Harry exhibits a rare ability to speak 'Parseltongue', the language of snakes.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect Draco is the Heir, given his hostility toward Muggle-borns. Hermione brews Polyjuice Potion, allowing Harry and Ron to impersonate Draco's lackeys Crabbe and Goyle. They learn that Draco knows nothing about the heir. Meanwhile, Moaning Myrtle, a ghost that haunts a girls' bathroom, shows the trio a diary left in her stall. It belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who witnessed another student's death during the Chamber's previous opening. Riddle's consciousness within the diary claims that Hagrid was responsible. Hermione is petrified in the next attack. The school is put on lockdown and may close. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore is forced out and Hagrid is sent to Azkaban prison.
Following instructions left by Hagrid, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the Forbidden Forest. They encounter Aragog, a gigantic Acromantula which denies its involvement, and claims spiders fear the real monster. Aragog attempts to feed Harry and Ron to its progeny, but Mr Weasley's car rescues them. Harry and Ron discover that Hermione deduced the monster is a basilisk – a gigantic snake whose direct gaze kills and petrifies victims when seen in a reflection. The basilisk is the voice in the walls, and it travels through the plumbing. Moaning Myrtle was the student that was killed.
Ron's sister Ginny is abducted and taken into the Chamber. Harry and Ron discover the entrance in Myrtle's bathroom, and force Lockhart to enter it with them. Lockhart confesses he is a fraud who made up all of his stories and attempts to erase the boys' memories after stealing Ron's damaged wand. The spell backfires, obliterating his own memory, and causes a cave-in; Ron is separated from Harry and stays behind to help Lockhart.
Harry proceeds to the Chamber and finds an unconscious Ginny. A manifestation of Tom Riddle reveals he is Lord Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. He opened the Chamber and framed Hagrid. He has been using the diary to possess and control Ginny, who had been behaving strangely. The basilisk appears to kill Harry. Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes arrives, bringing Harry the Sorting Hat. Fawkes blinds the basilisk and Harry pulls the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Hat. He slays the basilisk but is poisoned by its venom. As Riddle taunts the dying Harry, Fawkes' tears heal Harry. Harry stabs Riddle's diary with a severed basilisk fang, destroying it and Riddle's body, and reviving Ginny.
Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart return to the castle. Harry gives the diary to Dumbledore. Lucius bursts in, furious that Dumbledore returned. He is accompanied by Dobby, who is the Malfoys' house-elf and was working to protect Harry. Harry realizes that Lucius slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron while they were in Diagon Alley to open the Chamber. Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby from servitude by giving him a sock; Lucius attempts to attack Harry in revenge, but Dobby repels him.
The petrified students are cured, Gryffindor wins the House Cup again, Hagrid is released, Lockhart is confined to St. Mungo's Hospital, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in high spirits.
J.K Rowling found it difficult to finish Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision. In early drafts of the book, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick sang a self-composed song explaining his condition and the circumstances of his unknown death. This was cut because the book's editor did not care for the poem, which has been subsequently published as an extra on J. K. Rowling's official website. The family background of Dean Thomas was removed because Rowling and her publishers considered it an "unnecessary digression," and she considered Neville Longbottom's own journey of discovery "more important to the central plot."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999. It immediately took first place in UK bestseller lists, displacing popular authors such as John Grisham, Tom Clancy and Terry Pratchett, and making Rowling the first author to win the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year for two years in succession. In June 1999, it went straight to the top of three US bestseller lists, including in The New York Times.
First edition printings had several errors, which were fixed in subsequent reprints. Initially, Dumbledore said Voldemort was the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin instead of his descendant. Gilderoy Lockhart's book on werewolves is entitled Weekends with Werewolves at one point and Wanderings with Werewolves later in the book.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was met with near-universal acclaim. Reviewers described it as a children's book that would be "re-read into adulthood" with "strong plots, engaging characters, excellent jokes and a moral message which flows naturally from the story." Fantasy author Charles de Lint considered the second Harry Potter book to be just as good as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, a rare achievement among series of books. Some reviewers found the book more disturbing than its predecessor, particularly in the rash behaviour of Harry and his friends and the human-like behaviour of the mandragoras. Overall, the book was considered to give pleasure to both children and adult readers.
Writing after all seven books had been published, one reviewer regarded Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the weakest of the series, and agreed that the plot structure is much the same as in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina, saying the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry and that Fawkes's timing had to be very precise.
Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was the recipient of several awards. The American Library Association listed the novel among its 2000 Notable Children's Books, as well as its Best Books for Young Adults. In 1999, Booklist named Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as one of its Editors' Choices, and as one of its Top Ten Fantasy Novels for Youth. The Cooperative Children's Book Center made the novel a CCBC Choice of 2000 in the "Fiction for Children" category. The novel also won Children's Book of the Year British Book Award, and was shortlisted for the 1998 Guardian Children's Award and the 1998 Carnegie Award.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize 1998 Gold Medal in the 9–11 years division. Rowling also won two other Nestlé Smarties Book Prizes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The Scottish Arts Council awarded their first ever Children's Book Award to the novel in 1999, and it was also awarded Whitaker's Platinum Book Award in 2001. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 23 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets continues to examine what makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As well as maintaining that Harry's identity is shaped by his decisions rather than any aspect of his birth, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart "lacks any real identity" because he is nothing more than a charming liar. Riddle also complicates Harry's struggle to understand himself by pointing out the similarities between the two: "both half-bloods, orphans raised by Muggles, probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin."
Opposition to class, death and its impacts, experiencing adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant themes of the series. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.
Edward Duffy, associate professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.
Antonello Fabio Caterino, an Italian forensic linguist and philologist, stated that the conversations Harry and Voldemort had through the diary could be considered a "modern transposition" of Petrarca's Secretum, a text often compared to a diary, which details an imaginary dialogue between the writer and Augustine of Hippo. Caterino analysed similarities between themes found in both books, starting from the idea of a fragmented soul: Harry and Voldemort are both seeking Voldemort's Horcruxes, which are fragments of his soul, and Petrarca also focuses on the concept animae fragmenta, meaning soul's fragments.
Immorality and the portrayal of authority as negative are significant themes in the novel. Marguerite Krause states there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter's world, for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he considers it necessary – very like his enemy Draco Malfoy. At the end of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore retracts his promise to punish Harry and Ron if they break any more school rules – after Professor McGonagall estimates they have broken over 100 – and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat from the Chamber of Secrets. Krause further states that authority figures and political institutions receive little respect from Rowling. William MacNeil of Griffith University, Queensland, Australia states that the Minister for Magic is presented as a mediocrity. In his article "Harry Potter and the Secular City", Ken Jacobson suggests the Ministry as a whole is portrayed as a tangle of bureaucratic empires, saying that "Ministry officials busy themselves with minutiae (e.g. standardising cauldron thicknesses) and coin politically correct euphemisms like 'non-magical community' (for Muggles) and 'memory modification' (for magical brainwashing)."
This novel implies it begins in 1992: the cake for Nearly-Headless Nick's 500th deathday party bears the words "Sir Nicholas De Mimsy Porpington died 31 October 1492".
Chamber of Secrets has many links with the sixth book of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. In fact, Half-Blood Prince was the working title of Chamber of Secrets and Rowling says she originally intended to present some "crucial pieces of information" in the second book, but ultimately felt "this information's proper home was book six". Some objects that play significant roles in Half-Blood Prince first appear in Chamber of Secrets: the Hand of Glory and the opal necklace that are on sale in Borgin and Burkes; a Vanishing Cabinet in Hogwarts that is damaged by Peeves the Poltergeist; and Tom Riddle's diary, which is later revealed to be a Horcrux. Additionally, these two novels are the ones with the most focus on Harry's relationship with Ginny Weasley.
The film version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was released in 2002. Chris Columbus directed the film, and the screenplay was written by Steve Kloves. It became the third film to exceed $600 million in international box office sales, preceded by Titanic, released in 1997, and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, released in 2001. The film was nominated for a Saturn Award for the Best Fantasy Film. According to Metacritic, the film version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets received "generally favourable reviews" with an average score of 63%, and another aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, gave it a score of 82%.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. The first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, Harry Potter follows a young wizard who discovers Harry Potter's magical heritage on Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, when Harry Potter receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter makes close friends and a few enemies during Harry Potter's first year at the school and with the help of Harry Potter's friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry Potter faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry Potter's parents, but failed to kill Harry Potter when Harry Potter was just 15 months old.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999, and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of the book's sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making the novel the fourth best-selling book of all time.
Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullying.
The Harry Potter series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.
Harry Potter lives with Harry Potter's neglectful uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, delivers an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, revealing that Harry Potter's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards. When Harry Potter was just a year old, a powerful but malevolent dark wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered Harry Potter's parents; Harry Potter survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry Potter's forehead. Unknown to Harry Potter, this act made Harry Potter famous in the wizarding world.
Hagrid escorts Harry Potter to Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in London. Harry Potter's parents have left Harry Potter a fortune kept in Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which Harry Potter uses to buy school supplies and a wand from Ollivander's. The cores of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, making the wands "brothers". Hagrid gifts Harry Potter an owl, whom Harry Potter names as Hedwig, as a birthday present. A month later, Harry Potter boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9+3⁄4. En route to Hogwarts, Harry Potter befriends fellow first year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two students initially dislike.
Harry Potter runs afoul of Draco Malfoy, the spoiled son of a prominent wizard. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards, while Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger are sorted into Gryffindor.
Harry Potter's broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. Harry Potter comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy tricks Harry Potter and Ron Weasley into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after curfew. Hermione Granger, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley later save Hermione Granger from a troll during a Halloween celebration and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger believe Snape is attempting to enter the trapdoor.
During Harry Potter's first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to buck him off. Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione Granger he jinxed Harry Potter's broom. Harry Potter receives an anonymous Christmas gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires. Harry Potter sees his parents.
A newspaper report later describes an attempted robbery at the same vault in Gringotts from which Rubeus Hagrid retrieved an item for Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. The object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Firenze, a forest centaur, warns Harry Potter that Voldemort is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.
As you've described, various obstacles force Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to remain behind while Harry Potter proceeds. Harry Potter encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Quirrell jinxed Harry's broom and let the troll into the school; Severus Snape was actually protecting Harry. Voldemort, whose face has regrown on the back of Quirrell's head, is revealed to be the professor's secret master. Harry Potter is forced to stand before the Mirror of Erised. The mirror recognises Harry's lack of greed for the philosopher's stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. Harry's scar begins hurting, and he passes out.
Harry Potter awakens in the school's infirmary. He survived Voldemort because his mother Lily sacrificing her life for him left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned Quirrell to die. Albus Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas Flamel alive, has been destroyed with Flamel's consent to prevent it being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry Potter returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school year.
Harry Potter, a young orphan, is the protagonist Rowling imagined as "a scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard." Rowling developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry Potter came to be in this situation and how Harry's life unfolded from there.Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry Potter's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry Potter's forehead, which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry Potter has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.
Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's age, is Rowling's description of the ultimate best friend "always there when you need him".Ron Weasley is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. Ron Weasley grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although Ron Weasley's family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. Ron Weasley's loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.
Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione Granger as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath Hermione Granger's swottiness". Despite Hermione Granger's nagging efforts to keep Harry Potter and Ron Weasley out of trouble, Hermione Granger becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save Hermione Granger from a troll and Hermione Granger's magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. Hermione Granger has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.
Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that Neville Longbottom's grandmother gives Neville Longbottom a Remembrall, to remind Neville Longbottom if Neville Longbottom forgets something. Neville Longbottom's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save Neville Longbottom's life when Neville Longbottom was eight. Despite Neville Longbottom's timidity, Neville Longbottom will fight anyone after some encouragement or if Neville Longbottom thinks it is right and important.
Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and Rubeus Hagrid's wand was snapped in half (resulting in Rubeus Hagrid never to use a wand again), though Professor Dumbledore let Rubeus Hagrid stay on as the school's gamekeeper, a job which enables Rubeus Hagrid to give lavish affection, care and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Rubeus Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and, later, Hermione Granger, but Rubeus Hagrid's carelessness makes Rubeus Hagrid unreliable.
Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into Professor Albus Dumbledore's belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Professor Albus Dumbledore, while renowned for Professor Albus Dumbledore's achievements in magic, shrugs off praise, though Professor Albus Dumbledore is aware of Professor Albus Dumbledore's own brilliance. Rowling described Professor Albus Dumbledore as the "epitome of goodness".
Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun, teaches Transfiguration and is able to transform Professor Minerva McGonagall into a cat. Professor Minerva McGonagall is Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.
Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry Potter's mother Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that Petunia Dursley uses for spying on the neighbours. As a Muggle, Petunia Dursley regards Petunia Dursley's magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that Lily never existed.
Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.
Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoilt bully and Harry Potter's cousin.
Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. Draco Malfoy is arrogant about Draco Malfoy's skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard and wizards who do not share Draco Malfoy's views. Draco Malfoy's parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco Malfoy avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry Potter and Harry Potter's friends into trouble.
Oliver Wood is Harry Potter's Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering, and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. Reputedly Professor Quirrell was a brilliant scholar, but Professor Quirrell's nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Professor Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that Professor Quirrell is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Professor Quirrell's head.
Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Professor Severus Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, Professor Severus Snape's own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry Potter. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry Potter's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry Potter and Harry Potter's friends to think Professor Severus Snape is aiding Voldemort.
Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins, has a cat named Mrs. Norris who aids Argus Filch's constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.
Other members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed Professor Binns' own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever Peeves can.
In the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry Potter's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero, Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes Harry Potter's miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined Harry as a "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard" and says Rowling transferred part of Rowling's pain about losing Rowling's mother to Harry.
During the book, Harry Potter makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, "always there when you need him". Rowling has described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".
Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described Albus Dumbledore as "the epitome of goodness". Albus Dumbledore's right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.
The main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate, and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when Voldemort tries to kill baby Harry Potter. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and Voldemort's backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:
The basic idea... Harry, Rowling saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And Rowling knew Harry didn't know Harry was a wizard. And so then Rowling kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, and then Voldemort tried to kill Harry—Voldemort tried to curse him. But for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, Voldemort, who has been in hiding ever since.
The book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990, Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, "One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product." Then, Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. 
Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to a literary agent and a publisher and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was "so much better than anything else".
Bloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 advance and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched. Cunningham was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to Cunningham and Cunningham believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the pen name J. K. Rowling just before publication.
In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries. Rowling's original name, "Joanne Rowling", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to "Joanne" completely.) The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers. Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction. Taylor created the cover for the first edition.
Lindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments, wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997. Fraser described Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as "a hugely entertaining thriller" and Rowling as "a first-rate writer for children". Another early review, in The Herald, said: "I have yet to find a child who can put it down." Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in The Guardian and The Sunday Times and in September 1997 Books for Keeps, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five. Sunday Times said: "comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified", while The Guardian called it "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit" and The Scotsman said it had "all the makings of a classic".
In 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. The Smarties award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years. The following year, Philosopher's Stone won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children. It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults, but did not win. Beckett commented that books that were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example, the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year. By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001. A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.
Platform 9+3⁄4, from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.
Scholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book. Arthur Levine thought that "philosopher" sounded too archaic for readers and after some discussion (including the proposed title "Harry Potter and the School of Magic"), the American edition was published in September 1998 under the title J.K. Rowling suggested, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. J.K. Rowling later said that J.K. Rowling regretted this change and would have fought it if J.K. Rowling had been in a stronger position at the time. Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from "crumpet" to "muffin". While J.K. Rowling accepted the change from both the British English "mum" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant "mam" to the American variant "mom" in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, J.K. Rowling vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of Philosopher's Stone. However, Philip Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits. Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.
On BookBrowse, a site that aggregates book reviews such as media reviews, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone received a favorable review from "Critics' Opinion". At first, the most prestigious reviewers ignored Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which noted complexity, depth, and consistency in the world that J.K. Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise. A year later, the US edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1998, and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone also won Parenting Magazine's Book of the Year Award for 1998, the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults. In 2012, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was ranked number 3 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by School Library Journal.
In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone topped the New York Times list of best-selling fiction and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings. Publishers Weekly's report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).
In May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that was released on 1 October 2008 to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release. For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.
By mid-2008, official translations of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had been published in 67 languages. By November 2017, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Lowland Scots. Bloomsbury published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek, with the latter being described as "one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries".
Philip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom J.K. Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both Jane Austen and J.K. Rowling greatly encourage re-reading because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the storyline. For example, Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry Potter often has to re-examine Harry Potter's ideas near the ends of books. Some social behavior in the Harry Potter books is reminiscent of Austen, for example, the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirize social behavior and give characters names that express their personalities. However, in Philip Nel's opinion, J.K. Rowling's humor is more based on caricature, and the names J.K. Rowling invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories. Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these names express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. J.K. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C. S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Philip Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, J.K. Rowling combines literary genres—fantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman, and many others.
Some reviewers compared Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as Roald Dahl's successor, but none had attained anything near Roald Dahl's popularity with children. In a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Roald Dahl, including the one in the top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone resembled parts of Roald Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost James's parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts, one fat and one thin, rather like Vernon and Petunia Dursley, who treated Harry Potter as a servant. However, Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.
Nancy Knapp and Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley. Tad Brennan commented that J.K. Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer: "rapid, plain, and direct in expression." Stephen King admired "the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable" and concluded that these details worked because J.K. Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.
Nicholas Tucker described the early Harry Potter books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories. Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school where the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which the teachers were associated. Characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with Vernon and Petunia Dursley. Evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs. Norris. Harry Potter, a mistreated orphan who found Harry Potter's true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society, including many social stereotypes. However, Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.
Susan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the Harry Potter books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability, or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer Voldemort's own horrific version of order. As a side effect, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione Granger notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.
Philip Nel suggested that the unflattering characterization of the extremely conventional, status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was J.K. Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the "preferred norm," while J.K. Rowling was a single mother. Harry Potter's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in Harry Potter's happiness whenever Harry Potter is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in Harry Potter's treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father figures.
The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and later in the US on 2 June 1999. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 simultaneously by Bloomsbury and Scholastic. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release. The seventh and final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published on 21 July 2007. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.
An illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released on 6 October 2015, with illustrations by Jim Kay. The illustrated version carries over 100 illustrations and will be followed by illustrated versions of all seven books in the series by the same artist.
In May 2020, Spotify created a reading podcast entitled Harry Potter at Home: Readings. Each chapter is narrated by a celebrity guest from the Harry Potter and Wizarding World franchises.
In 1999, J.K. Rowling sold the film rights of the first two Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported £1 million. Rowling demanded that the principal cast be kept strictly British, but allowed for the casting of Irish actors such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore and of foreign actors as characters of the same nationalities in later books. After extensive casting, filming of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone began in September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London, with production ending in July 2001. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released in London on 14 November 2001. Reviewers' comments were positive, as reflected by an 81% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and by a score of 65% at Metacritic, representing "generally favourable reviews".
Writers on education and business subjects have used the book as an object lesson. Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students, while Madam Hooch illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills. Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class.
Stephen Brown noted that the early Harry Potter books, especially Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to treat the stories as "a marketing masterclass", full of enticing products and brand names. For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was introduced under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.

Hermione Jean Granger is a character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, first appearing in the novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997) aboard the Hogwarts express as a first-year student. Following her rescue by Harry and Ron from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she forms a close friendship with them. Hermione frequently relies on her quick wit, excellent memory, and vast knowledge to assist in critical situations. Rowling has noted Hermione's similarity to herself as a young girl, particularly in terms of insecurity and fear of failure.
The character has gained immense popularity. Emma Watson's portrayal of Hermione in all eight Harry Potter films, spanning from Philosopher's Stone in 2001 to Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in 2011, was acclaimed as the greatest female character of all time in a poll among Hollywood professionals conducted by The Hollywood Reporter in 2016.
Hermione Jean Granger, a Muggle-born Gryffindor, becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. J. K. Rowling states Hermione's birthdate as 19 September 1979, and Hermione was nearly twelve when Hermione first attended Hogwarts. Hermione excels academically, described by Rowling as "very logical, upright, and good". Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, find their unusual daughter bemusing but are quite proud of Hermione. Hermione's parents are familiar with the wizarding world and have accompanied Hermione to Diagon Alley. Hermione is an only child. Rowling mentioned in a 2004 interview that Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, though the character was not introduced due to timing concerns. Rowling contrasts Hermione with Luna Lovegood, describing Luna as the "anti-Hermione" due to their stark differences.
Rowling said Hermione Jean Granger has several autobiographical influences: "I did not set out to make Hermione like me but Hermione is a bit like me. Hermione is an exaggeration of how I was when I was younger." She recalled being called a "little know-it-all" in her youth. And Rowling says that not unlike herself, "there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure" beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to Albus Dumbledore, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of Hermione's encyclopedic knowledge, Hermione can always be used as a plot dump to explain the Harry Potter universe. Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, "who's the brightest witch of her age" and a "very strong female character."
Hermione's first name is taken from a character in William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, though Rowling has said that the two characters have little to nothing in common. Rowling said that she wanted Hermione's name to be unusual since if fewer girls had Hermione's name, fewer girls would get teased for it and Hermione's name seemed the sort of name that "a pair of professional dentists, who liked to prove how clever they were" would give their daughter. Hermione's original surname was "Puckle", but Rowling felt the name "did not suit Hermione at all", and so the less frivolous Granger was used.
Hermione Jean Granger first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone when Hermione meets Harry and Ron on the Hogwarts Express, where Hermione mocks Ron for his inability to perform a spell to turn his rat yellow. Hermione proves just how much Hermione knows by declaring that Hermione memorized all the textbooks by heart. Hermione constantly annoys Hermione's peers with Hermione's knowledge, so Harry and Ron initially consider Hermione arrogant, especially after Hermione criticises Ron's incantation of the Levitation Charm. Harry and Ron heartily dislike Hermione until Harry and Ron rescue Hermione from a troll, for which Hermione is so thankful that Hermione lies to protect Harry and Ron from punishment, thus winning Hermione's friendship. Hermione's knack for logic later enables the trio to solve a puzzle that is essential to retrieving the Philosopher's Stone, and Hermione defeats the constrictive Devil's Snare plant by summoning a jet of "bluebell flame".
Hermione Jean Granger is the brains behind the plan to enter the place where the Stone is hidden. Hermione responds to Harry's wariness of Professor Severus Snape and is also suspicious of Snape. Hermione reveals to Harry and Ron that Hermione does a lot of research in the library, which helped Hermione defeat the Devil's Snare and work out the logic of the potions.
Rowling said on Rowling's website that Rowling resisted Rowling's editor's requests to remove the troll scene, stating "Hermione is so very arrogant and annoying in the early part of Philosopher's Stone that Rowling really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring Hermione together with Harry and Ron."
Hermione Jean Granger (along with Molly Weasley and a few female students of Hogwarts) develops a liking for Defence Against the Dark Arts (DADA) teacher Gilderoy Lockhart as he had written all the books required for DADA in Chamber of Secrets. During a morning confrontation between the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, a brawl nearly ensues after Draco Malfoy calls Hermione a "Mudblood", an insulting epithet for Muggle-born wizards, when Hermione defends the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Hermione concocts the Polyjuice Potion needed for the trio to disguise themselves as Draco's housemates to collect information about the Heir of Slytherin, who has reopened the Chamber of Secrets. However, Hermione is unable to join Harry and Ron in the investigation after the hair plucked from the robes of Slytherin student Millicent Bulstrode (with whom Hermione was previously matched up during Lockhart's ill-fated Duelling Club) turns out to be that of her cat, whose appearance she takes on in her human form; it takes several weeks for the effects to completely wear off. Hermione is Petrified by the basilisk after successfully identifying the creature through library research. Though Hermione lies incapacitated in the hospital wing, the information Hermione has found and left behind is crucial to Harry and Ron in their successful mission to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione is revived after Harry kills the basilisk, but Hermione is distraught to learn that all end-of-year exams have been cancelled as a school treat.
Hermione Jean Granger buys a cat named Crookshanks, who takes to chasing Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. Before the start of term, Professor Minerva McGonagall secretly gives Hermione a Time-Turner, a device which lets Hermione go back in time and handle Hermione's heavy class schedule, though this is not revealed until the penultimate chapter. Much tension comes into play between Hermione and Hermione's two best friends; Harry is furious with Hermione because Hermione told McGonagall that Harry got a Firebolt, which was confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic. Ron is angry because he feels Crookshanks caused Scabbers' disappearance, while Hermione fiercely maintains that Crookshanks is innocent.
While filling in for Remus Lupin in one DADA class, Snape labels Hermione Jean Granger "an insufferable know-it-all" and penalises Gryffindor after Hermione speaks out of turn in Hermione's attempt to describe a werewolf when no one else does. Hermione correctly deduces Lupin's secret after completing Snape's homework assignment from the class. Crookshanks proves vital in exposing Scabbers as Peter Pettigrew, an erstwhile friend of James and Lily Potter, who revealed their whereabouts to Voldemort the night of their murders, and was able to wrongly implicate Sirius Black (revealed to be Harry's godfather) in the Potters' deaths. The Time-Turner enables Hermione and Harry Potter to rescue Sirius and the hippogriff Buckbeak.
Hermione Jean Granger is horrified by the cruelty that house-elves suffer and establishes S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, as an effort to gain basic rights for them. Hermione is Bulgarian Quidditch prodigy Viktor Krum's date at the Yule Ball of the Triwizard Tournament. The proper pronunciation of Hermione's name (Her-my-oh-nee) is interjected into the plot when Hermione teaches it to Krum; the best he can do is "Herm-own-ninny," but Hermione has no problem with it. Hermione later gets into a heated argument with Ron after Ron accuses Hermione of "fraternising with the enemy" about Hermione's friendship with Krum. In the book, Hermione's feelings toward Ron are hinted at when Hermione says that Ron cannot see Hermione "like a girl," but Krum could. Hermione supports Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. At the end of the second task, Krum asks Hermione to come to see him over the summer in Bulgaria, but Hermione politely declines. Near the end of term, Hermione stops fraudulent tabloid reporter and unregistered Animagus, Rita Skeeter, who had published defamatory material about Hermione, Harry, and Hagrid during the Triwizard Tournament, by holding Rita Skeeter's Animagus form (a beetle) captive in a jar.
Hermione Jean Granger becomes a Gryffindor prefect along with Ron and befriends Luna Lovegood, but Hermione's friendship with Luna has a rocky start after Hermione chastises the publication of Luna's father: "The Quibbler's rubbish, everyone knows that." Hermione also lambasts housemate Lavender Brown for believing the Daily Prophet's allegations of Harry fabricating stories of Voldemort's return. Ron and Hermione spend much of their time bickering, likely due to their growing romantic feelings toward one another, but they show continued loyalty to Harry Potter. One turning point in the series is when Hermione conceives the idea of Harry secretly teaching defensive magic to a small band of students in defiance of the Ministry of Magic's dictum to teach only the subject's basic principles from a textbook, with no hands-on practice. Hermione gets an unexpectedly huge response, and the group becomes the nascent Dumbledore's Army. Hermione is involved in the battle in the Department of Mysteries and is seriously injured by a spell from Death Eater Antonin Dolohov, but Hermione makes a full recovery.

Hermione is involved in the battle in the Department of Mysteries and is seriously injured by a spell from Death Eater Antonin Dolohov, but Hermione makes a full recovery.
In the seventh and last book, Hermione Jean Granger accompanies Harry Potter on his quest to destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, Hermione helps ensure the safety of her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them think they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. Hermione inherits Dumbledore's copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which allows her to decipher some secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so Hermione can fill the infinite depths of the bag with things they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, though the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are caught by Snatchers, who are hunting for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. Hermione also tries to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but they are recognized and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione with a Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Bellatrix orders Griphook the goblin to inspect the sword and tell whether it is fake or real. To save Hermione, Harry convinces him to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron, and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.
Hermione Jean Granger later uses Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Bellatrix Lestrange when she, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley steal Hufflepuff's cup (a Horcrux) from Gringotts. Hermione, Harry, and Ron join Dumbledore's Army in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which Hermione destroys Hufflepuff's cup in the Chamber of Secrets with a basilisk fang. Hermione and Ron also share their first kiss during the battle after Ron suggests saving the house-elves who are trapped in the kitchens. In the final battle in the Great Hall, Hermione fights Bellatrix Lestrange with the help of Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood. However, the three of them are unable to defeat Bellatrix and stop fighting her once Molly Weasley orders them to disengage.
In the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Hermione Jean Granger and Ron Weasley have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo. Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Hermione and Ron are married, news articles and other sources treat it as fact.
In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, it is shown that Hermione Jean Granger has become Minister for Magic, succeeding Kingsley Shacklebolt.
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child describe Hermione Jean Granger as having "bushy brown hair" and brown eyes. Her front buck teeth, already very large, grow uncontrollably in Goblet of Fire after she is affected by a spell cast by Draco Malfoy. Madam Pomfrey attends to Hermione in the hospital wing and, at Hermione's request, shrinks the teeth down to a normal size that matches Hermione's mouth.
In the films, Hermione's hair is less bushy and she always has regular teeth except for a scene at the end of Philosopher's Stone where Emma Watson wore fake teeth. Emma Watson stopped wearing them for the rest of the films because they caused difficulties in speech.
There is controversy over whether Hermione Jean Granger's skin colour is ever categorically established in the books. Some take as proof a line from Prisoner of Azkaban: "Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree." They interpret this as a direct description of her skin tone. Others interpret it as a description relative to her usual complexion, arising due to fright and anxiety as she watches Harry Potter's attempt to save the hippogriff Buckbeak from execution. J.K. Rowling herself says Hermione "turned white" in that she "lost colour from her face after a shock."
Another description from early in Prisoner of Azkaban is: "They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour, Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him." Some claim this is a direct description of Hermione Jean Granger's skin colour, while others claim it's a relative description of the results of a tan acquired over the summer break.
Hermione Jean Granger's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and always very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian and teacher to gather the information needed to defeat Voldemort, the "Dark Lord". When in doubt, Hermione always turns to the school library. She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can always be counted on. J.K. Rowling said that Hermione "never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done." Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says Hermione has "quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality," as well as a "sense of insecurity underneath," feels, "utterly inadequate... and to compensate, Hermione tries and strives to be the best at everything at school, projecting a confidence that irritates people." During Hermione's DADA exam at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione reveals that her biggest fear is failure after a Boggart takes the form of Professor McGonagall and tells Hermione that she has failed all her exams.
Hermione Jean Granger is extremely compassionate and very quick to help others, especially the defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. After publication of the last book, J.K. Rowling revealed that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of Harry Potter and Ron Weasley and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione looked in the Mirror of Erised, Hermione would see Harry, Ron, and herself alive and Voldemort defeated. Hermione also learns to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to Hermione, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart Draco Malfoy. Hermione accepts Hermione's status as a Muggle-born, and says in Deathly Hallows that Hermione is "a Mudblood and proud of it".
Hermione Jean Granger is portrayed during the whole series as an exceptionally talented young witch. J.K. Rowling has said that Hermione is a "borderline genius." Hermione got ten O.W.L.s, which were nine Outstanding and one Exceeds Expectations. Hermione is the best student in Harry Potter's year and is repeatedly the first student to master any spell or charm introduced in Hermione's classes and even from more advanced years, as evidenced when Hermione can conjure a Protean Charm on the D.A.'s fake Galleon coins, which is a N.E.W.T. level charm. Hermione is also the first one of Hermione's age to be able to cast non-verbal spells. Hermione is a competent duellist – Rowling has stated that during the first three books Hermione could have beaten Harry in any magical duel, but by the fourth book Harry had become so good at DADA that Harry would have defeated Hermione. Hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying did not come as naturally to Hermione in Hermione's first year as it did to Harry, and Hermione showed no affinity for Divination, which Hermione dropped from Hermione's third-year studies. Hermione was also not good at Wizard's Chess, as it was the only thing at which Hermione ever lost to Ron.
Hermione Jean Granger's Patronus is an otter, J.K. Rowling's favourite animal. In the Deathly Hallows book, while Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione enter the Ministry of Magic under disguise, Hermione impersonates Mafalda Hopkirk. Hermione's wand is made of vine wood and dragon heartstring core; vine is the wood ascribed to Hermione's fictional birth month (September) on the Celtic calendar.
Hermione Jean Granger is viewed by many as a feminist icon. In The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter, the first book-length analysis of the Harry Potter series (edited and compiled by Lana A. Whited), a chapter titled "Hermione Granger and the Heritage of Gender" by Eliza T. Dresang discusses Hermione's role in the series and its relation to feminist debates. The chapter begins with an analysis of Hermione's name and the role of previous characters with the same name in mythology and fiction, and the heritage Hermione has inherited from these characters due to Hermione's name. Dresang also emphasizes Hermione's parallelism with J.K. Rowling herself and how, as Hermione has some attributes from J.K. Rowling herself, Hermione must be a strong character.
The chapter also points out that, despite being born to Muggle parents, Hermione Jean Granger's magical abilities are innate. Hermione's "compulsion for study" helps both Hermione's development, making Hermione "a prime example that information brings power," and the plot of the series, as Hermione's knowledge of the wizarding world is often used to "save the day." Eliza T. Dresang states that "Harry Potter and Ron Weasley are more dependent on Hermione than Hermione is on them." However, Eliza T. Dresang adds that Hermione's "hysteria and crying happen far too often to be considered a believable part of the development of Hermione's character and are quite out of line with Hermione's core role in the book."
UGO Networks listed Hermione Jean Granger as one of their best heroes of all time, saying, "Most of us can probably recall having a classmate like Hermione when we were in grammar school"—one who "can at first be a little off-putting, but once you get to know Hermione, Hermione's not a bad chick to have on your side". IGN also listed Hermione as their second top Harry Potter character, praising Hermione's character development. In 2016 The Hollywood Reporter did a poll of Hollywood professionals, including actors, writers, and directors, into their favorite female characters of all time; Hermione topped the poll.
Philip Nel of Kansas State University notes that "Rowling, who worked for Amnesty International, evokes Rowling's social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of Hermione's 'Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare'". Scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books' abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers' political engagement.
However, in an analysis for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Rowland Manthrope states that "seven books on, we still only know Hermione as swottish, sensible Hermione—a caricature, not a character." In 2014, Rowling admitted that the finale of Rowling's story should have featured Hermione paired with Harry instead of Ron (Harry ends up marrying Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister).
Emma Watson played Hermione in all eight Harry Potter films. Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed Emma Watson's name on to the casting agents of Philosopher's Stone, impressed with Emma Watson's school play performances. Though Emma Watson took Emma Watson's audition seriously, Emma Watson "never really thought Emma Watson had any chance" of getting the part. Prior to Emma Watson being cast, the producers also considered another actress, Hatty Jones, who had auditioned alongside Emma Watson and had prior theatrical film experience in the 1998 film adoption of the children's book series Madeline; the casting team later deemed Hatty Jones outgrown and settled for Emma Watson, impressed by Emma Watson's self-confidence and outperforming the thousands of other girls who applied.
Rowling herself was supportive of Emma Watson after Emma Watson's first screen test. When asked if Rowling thought actors suited the characters, Rowling said, "Yes, I did. Emma Watson in particular was very, very like Hermione when I first spoke to Emma Watson, I knew Emma Watson was perfect from that first phone call."
Emma Watson was well-received for the first film; IGN even commented that "from Hermione Granger's perfect introduction to Emma Watson's final scene, Emma Watson is better than Emma Watson could have possibly imagined. Emma Watson steals the show." IGN also wrote that Emma Watson's "astute portrayal of Hermione has already become a favourite among fans."
Before the production of Half-Blood Prince, Emma Watson considered not returning, but eventually decided that "the pluses outweighed the minuses" and that Emma Watson could not bear to see anyone else play Hermione.
Emma Watson has said that Hermione is a character who makes "brain not beauty cool," and that though Hermione is "slightly socially inept," Emma Watson is "not ashamed of herself." When filming Chamber of Secrets, Emma Watson was "adamant" that Emma Watson wasn't like Hermione, but Emma Watson reflects that "as Emma Watson got older, Emma Watson realized Hermione was the greatest role model a girl could have." In 2007, before the release of Order of the Phoenix, Emma Watson said, "There are too many stupid girls in the media. Hermione's not scared to be clever. I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad. When Emma Watson was nine or ten, Emma Watson would get really upset when they tried to make Emma Watson look geeky, but now Emma Watson absolutely loves it. Emma Watson finds it's so much pressure to be beautiful. Hermione doesn't care what Hermione looks like. Hermione's a complete tomboy."
Screenwriter Steve Kloves revealed in a 2003 interview that Hermione was his favourite character. "There's something about Hermione's fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how Hermione affects people sometimes that I just find charming and irresistible to write."
In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Hermione is played by Eswatini-born actress Noma Dumezweni, known for her work in Linda, A Raisin in the Sun and A Human Being Died That Night. Noma Dumezweni described the role as a "privilege and a responsibility" and said that "we all aspire to be Hermione." The choice of a black actress to play Emma Watson led to criticism on social media, which J.K. Rowling described as being by "a bunch of racists", adding that the books never explicitly mention Emma Watson's race or skin tone and that Emma Watson has been portrayed as black in fan art. Noma Dumezweni herself called the backlash "so unimaginative," stating that "So many young actors and actresses have told Noma Dumezweni that they’re so pleased Noma Dumezweni is playing Hermione because they can see a version of themselves on the stage."
Noma Dumezweni received praise for Noma Dumezweni's performance; The Independent said that Noma Dumezweni "did a tremendous job as the stern witch." At the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, Noma Dumezweni won the Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Noma Dumezweni's portrayal of Hermione.
Hermione has been parodied in many sketches and animated series. On Saturday Night Live, Lindsay Lohan played Hermione. On Alistair McGowan's show Big Impression, there was a sketch titled "Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone" featuring impressions of Nigella Lawson as Hermione. In 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, in which Miranda Richardson, who plays Rita Skeeter in the Harry Potter films, featured as Hermione. Hermione also features in the Harry Bladder sketches in All That, where Hermione appears as Herheiny and is played by Lisa Foiles. The Wedge, an Australian sketch comedy, parodies Hermione and Harry in love on a "Cooking With..." show before being caught by Snape. Hermione also appears as Hermione Ranger in Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K., and Anna M. Lewis. In the 2008 American comedy film Yes Man, Allison (played by Zooey Deschanel) accompanies Carl (Jim Carrey) to a Harry Potter-themed party dressed as Hermione.
In Harry Cover, a French comic book parody of Harry Potter by Pierre Veys (later translated into Spanish and English), Hermione appears as Harry Cover's friend Hormone. Hermione also appears in Potter Puppet Pals sketches by Neil Cicierega; and in the A Very Potter Musical, A Very Potter Sequel, and A Very Potter Senior Year musicals by StarKid Productions played by Bonnie Gruesen in the first two and Meredith Stepien in the third.
Hermione is the focus of the fan-created web-series, Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis.
